## <b>About the project</b>

'Witcher Guessr' is an unofficial map location guessing game, based entirely on [The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt](https://www.thewitcher.com) made by [CD Projekt Red](https://www.cdprojektred.com).

Core gameplay loop revolves around carefully inspecting a 360Â° degree panorama image of a randomly selected place in the game world, and then accurately guessing its precise location in one of many maps from the game world.

Project is, and will for ever remain free and open-source, as an appreciation and as a nod to the talented team who have have brought The Witcher universe to life.
